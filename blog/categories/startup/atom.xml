    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was young, I remember asking my dad  - “what is an Entrepreneur?” Quickly, he responded - “it’s someone without a job, son.”</p>

<p>Well, it’s been three months since ‘having a job’ and these are some of the things I’ve learned.</p>

<h3>You have a job</h3>


<p>Despite what other people want to tell you - you have work to do. You actually DO stuff. You often work a lot. I’d entertain the fact that my hours are more flexible, but just because I’m doing yoga on a Tuesday morning - doesn’t mean I’m not up until 2am on a Thursday - working.
I originally thought that I’d be working every hour of everyday, to ensure success for my company. But, that’s truly not the case. When things need to get done, I ensure that they do - but, taking a break and letting your brain relax is often the best thing for my productivity. It is extremely important that you don’t pretend to work when you are not. It is okay to not be working all the time - in fact, I encourage it. Turns out, when you step away from work you often unconsciously solve problems you have been wrestling with.</p>

<h3>You have a boss</h3>


<p>It’s you - and that person should be the toughest critic you’ve worked for. It’s not good enough to be just satisfied with something you create. You must be proud of what you do, and you shouldn’t stop until you are. But often, you can’t always be your biggest motivator. Set up goals with your teammates and take time for some constructive criticism along the way. Do things with a purpose and the rest will fall into place.</p>

<h3>You have to be creative</h3>


<p>You finally get to ‘put your money where your mouth is.’ You have to sharpen your skills and show what you’ve got. Too many times, I said ‘cool’ or ‘motivating’ things in interviews, or with people - but could always fall back on the fact I had a job to tie me up. Now, I have a passion that needs to be relayed in my words and represented in my actions. You don’t get handed the silver platter (or paper plate) very often - so make a meal fit for a king.</p>

<h3>You have to make real decisions</h3>


<p>Every decision you make is critical. This should not scare you, but encourage you even further. Every decision you make sculpts who you are and what your business is. When you own your own business - each decision means much more. Sculpt with a chisel and not a brush.</p>

<h3>You have to enjoy the ride</h3>


<p>Sure, there is some stress and a few road bumps along the way - but, it’s important to enjoy the ups and the downs. Yes, enjoy the downs. You learn from the downs and it helps balance the ups. If each day you learn something new, and every day is based on how wise you are - then, every day should get better. It can be a financial burden to start your own shop, but I often tell myself, “some people save for traveling, some people save for school, I saved for starting a business.” And I’m okay with it. We may not be buying yachts, but we are progressing each day, as business owners and more importantly - as people. I’m learning how the world works without the superficial, financial safety blanket that my generation grows up with.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
I've named my blog Divisa C. It's Latin for "divided 100,000".
</p>




<p>
As of last week, I worked for IBM - which employs over 300,000 people. I quit to start <a href="http://understoodit.com" target="_blank">Understoodit</a> with just three.
</p>




<p>
Working for a large company has many pros and cons. I'll start with the pros, so I can end with the cons freshly in my mind to strengthen the decision I have already made. These are some of the things I learned at IBM:
</p>




<h3>Pros:</h3>


<p>
<strong>There are a lot of people:</strong> A lot of people mean a lot of resources. If you don't know something, I guarantee that someone else does. So ask.
<br>
<strong>There is a lot of money:</strong> Which means you'll likely get some of it. Consistently.
<br>
<strong>Their business model works:</strong> Big corporations are not in business to lose money. They've been around the block and know how to make it. Their success is driven from people who are making good business decisions. Be aware of the smart decisions that are made and try to fit them into your own life.
<br>
<strong>People know your company:</strong> When someone asks "what do you do?" you don't have to fiddle around with fluffing up your day job. You can say, "I work for IBM". People have heard of IBM. Then they will acknowledge with a smile, and you can now focus back on them. It's incredible how easy conversations work when you are simple.
<br>
<strong>You don't actually have to work that hard:</strong> You can - and you should. But, you don't have to. The culture in larger organizations are convoluted. A culture mirrors the work it breeds and at IBM you could get away with doing less.
<br>
<strong>Free pens and stuff.</strong>
<br>
</p>




<h3>Cons:</h3>


<p>
<strong>THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE:</strong> Doing the simple things are hard. There are rules, guidelines and policies. If you need a mouse - you'll likely need it to be signed off by your manager. And your manager's manager. And your manager's manager's manager (who you've never met - but sits thirty feet away). You get the point.
<br>
<strong>You don't actually WANT to work that hard:</strong> If you give a 5/10 or a 10/10, you'll likely get a 7/10. I like to work hard - but people don't recognize the work you've actually put in. Managers typically reward results when they should be rewarding effort. Effort goes unnoticed.
<br>
<strong>Culture:</strong> For someone young (I'm 26), you want to be around people like yourself. You want to work with people you'd be friends with. I don't hang out with people over 40 that often, but I did at work. It makes for a very tangled culture with many faces. Ask 50 people what the culture is like, and you'll get 50 different answers.
<br>
<strong>You don't say hi to everyone:</strong> No one will look at you as you walk in the building. A smirk is the only thing you'll get from an unknown colleague. A big company feels like a big city street. It's unfriendly.
<br>
<strong>People don't care:</strong> There is a diffusion of responsibility when it comes to anything. Especially when trying to develop young and eager talent. Rather then set them up for success, better drown them in boredom and uncertainty. But it's okay, because we are giving them a pay check and dental coverage - right? Wrong.
</p>




<p>
When I first wrote this post, I thought that working for a big company had more pros than cons. But I've been working full-time on a startup for only a week and I'm already more enthusiastic about my day-to-day life. I've been very fortunate to work for a company that put up with me while I learned the ropes and I never had to worry about them NOT paying me. The fact they even paid me at all still somewhat baffles me.
</p>




<p>
But it's time for me to be the boss. Make decisions and do work that has some greater social value. I hope you keep reading and I have something to talk about.
